I am a Senior Research Associate in Statistics at Lancaster University. My current research is on post-selection inference for changepoint models.

Previously I was a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham. My research focused on combining high-dimensional data from different sourcces to map urban deprivation in Tanzania.

During my PhD, which was also at the University of Nottingham, I worked on language models and word embeddings.

I am a Senior Research Associate in Statistics at Lancaster University. My current research focuses on post-selection inference for changepoint models. I have also worked as a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham, on combining high-dimensional data from different sourcces to map urban deprivation in Tanzania. My PhD, which was also at the University of Nottingham, focused on language models and word embeddings.
